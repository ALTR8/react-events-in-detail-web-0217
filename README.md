# React Mouse Events

## Objectives

1. Describe how we might use mouse events to enhance interactivity
2. Describe how we can attach and use click events

## Overview

Introduce students to the basics of mouse events (especially onClick).

Cover e.preventDefault(), e.stopPropagation(), attach events to a whole host of
things (intercepting clicks on anchor tags can be super handy, right?).
